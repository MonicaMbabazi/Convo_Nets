    "## Getting Started with DL in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by studying the DNN and its logical components, understanding\n",
    "what each component is used for and how these building blocks are\n",
    "mapped in the Keras framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at at these logical components one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Data\n",
    "Input data for a DL algorithm can be of a variety of types. Essentially,\n",
    "the model understands data as “tensors”. Tensors are nothing but a\n",
    "generic form for vectors, or in computer engineering terms, a simple\n",
    "n-dimensional matrix. Data of any form is finally represented as a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron\n",
    "At the core of the DNN, we have neurons where computation for an output\n",
    "is executed. A neuron receives one or more inputs from the neurons in\n",
    "the previous layer. If the neurons are in the first hidden layer, they will\n",
    "receive the data from the input data stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: neurons are like containers which take on some values and by use of some instructions (functions) they pass on a particular message to the next neuron depending on what particular result is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Function\n",
    "An activation function is the function that takes the combined input z as\n",
    "shown in the preceding illustration, applies a function on it, and passes\n",
    "the output value, thus trying to mimic the activate/deactivate function.\n",
    "The activation function, therefore, determines the state of a neuron by\n",
    "computing the activation function on the combined input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Simple terms: Their main purpose is to convert a input signal of a node in a A-NN to an output signal. That output signal now is used as a input in the next layer in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please take time to look at this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/activation-functions-and-its-types-which-is-better-a9a5310cc8f)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sigmoid Activation Function\n",
    "A sigmoid function is defined as\n",
    "1\n",
    "(1+ - ) e z , which renders the output\n",
    "between 0 and 1 as shown in the following illustration. The nonlinear\n",
    "output (s shaped as shown) improves the learning process very well, as it\n",
    "closely resembles the following principle—lower influence: low output and\n",
    "higher influence: higher output—and also confines the output within the\n",
    "0-to-1 range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ReLU Activation Function\n",
    "Similarly, the ReLU uses the function f(z) = max(0,z), which means that\n",
    "if the output is positive it would output the same value, otherwise it would\n",
    "output 0. The function’s output range is shown in the following visual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "The overall structure of a DNN is developed using the model object in\n",
    "Keras. This provides a simple way to create a stack of layers by adding new\n",
    "layers one after the other.\n",
    "The easiest way to define a model is by using the sequential model,\n",
    "which allows easy creation of a linear stack of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example showcases the creation of a simple sequential\n",
    "model with one layer followed by an activation. The layer would have 10\n",
    "neurons and would receive an input with 15 neurons and be activated with\n",
    "the ReLU activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    from keras.models import Sequential\n",
    "    from keras.layers import Dense, Activation\n",
    "    model = Sequential()\n",
    "    model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=15))\n",
    "    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layers\n",
    "A layer in the DNN is defined as a group of neurons or a logically separated\n",
    "group in a hierarchical network structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the types of layers in an MLP as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Layer: Input variables, sometimes called the visible layer.\n",
    "- Hidden Layers: Layers of nodes between the input and output layers. There may be one or more of these layers.\n",
    "- Output Layer: A layer of nodes that produce the output variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Have Multiple Layers?\n",
    "Before we look at how many layers to specify, it is important to think about why we would want to have multiple layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single-layer neural network can only be used to represent linearly separable functions. This means very simple problems where, say, the two classes in a classification problem can be neatly separated by a line. If your problem is relatively simple, perhaps a single layer network would be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most problems that we are interested in solving are not linearly separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Multilayer Perceptron can be used to represent convex regions. This means that in effect, they can learn to draw shapes around examples in some high-dimensional space that can separate and classify them, overcoming the limitation of linear separability.\n",
