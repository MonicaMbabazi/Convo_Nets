# Convo_Nets
This folder contains my first exploitations with Neural Nets

In this project I am working on getting up to speed with Neural Networks.

I have read some good resources, some of which I will reference in the Notebooks.

I am writting these notebooks in a simple way because I would like some people to learn from them and also for me they will be a go to when I have presentations to make on some of these topics or when I am teaching classes. I will break them down in simple terms and language for your understanding.

Good Luck on your journey

PS: Please start with the simple files and move on to more complex stuff in time.
